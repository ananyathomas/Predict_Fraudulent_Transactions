This project compares the performance of four machine learning models in a binary classification problem for prediction fraudulent transactions.The models compared are:

Logistic Regression
Naive-Bayes
K-nearest neighbours
Decision tree

# Outcome
On comparing the four models the accuracy of the Decison tree model is found to be the best followed by K-Nearest neighboursand then Logistic Regression. Naive Bayes is found to have the least accuracy.
